      ``,
      `Q. Good morning Apurva, we are contacting you from Peer Support. How have you been?
    `,
      `Ans. Good morning to you too, I’ve been doing well.
    `,
      `Q. Tell us more about yourself.
    `,
      `Ans. My name is Apurva Tidke. I am from Nagpur. I did my early schooling back in Nagpur, further, I pursued my engineering degree in Computer Science from KITS College.  After that I started preparing for UPSC Civil Services Examination. I have devoted 7 years of my life preparing for UPSC. During this period I have also worked in a company called Cactus Communications where I edited research papers from all over the globe. I am inclined towards literature and content from the beginning and have published a novel. After my stint with Cactus, I started working as a VARC trainer. I taught VARC at TIME Ludhiana and then joined Tarkashastra (Pune) as the Study Abroad Head. During COVID years I worked as a mentor for UPSC aspirants on an online platform.
 
    `,
      `Q. You have mentioned something regarding publishing a novel, could you shed some light on that aspect?`,
      `Ans. Yes, I am a published novelist. I have written a novel called ‘Fantasy Girl’ which explores the themes of patriarchy and women's role in society where I have tried to offer a nuanced perspective with respect to how injustice against women is a societal issue, not an individual woman’s issue.`,
      `Q. Being a married woman as well as a working professional, how did you manage CAT preparation along with your family and job?
    `,
      `Ans. As I have mentioned VARC has been one of my strengths. I tried to capitalize as much as possible in this section and manage the other two. For LRDI and Quants, I followed Arun Sharma’s books. Here I applied a selective approach of choosing the sections yielding more questions in CAT. I tried to focus more on them. I used to give mocks regularly although the frequency used to get hampered due to exhaustion from non-academic areas. While giving mocks I used to attempt maximum questions in VARC and select the easier and moderate questions in LRDI and Quants. After every mock, the most important part is to analyze them. If I faced any difficulty in any subject or regarding any preparation, I approached my colleagues or friends and asked for help. They have always motivated, helped, and guided me throughout this journey.
    `,
      `Q5. How tough was the interview for different IITs? What were some of the intriguing questions that were asked to you?
    `,
      `Ans. The interview approach differs for different colleges. In IIT Madras, the interview was subject-oriented where I was asked questions related to statistics and other subjects. The interview for IIT Delhi was personality-oriented, where they asked me questions related to my published novel and my work experience. They began with HR questions like why MBA, and future goals. Then they asked:
    -        What was the thought process involved in writing the novel?
    -        How work experience helped me become a better person and what qualities did I pick up from it?
    -        Since you have completed long back do you look at yourself as an engineer?
     
    `,
      `Q. Why IIT Delhi?
    `,
      `Ans: IIT Delhi is one of the top-notch B-schools in the country which is consistently growing. This itself opens multiple opportunities in the sphere of management. Apart from my inclination towards literature and content, I have an interest in technology. In my work experience, I used to edit research articles. The technical bent motivated me to pursue my MBA from an ecosystem providing management knowledge with exposure to technology. Location and connectivity are also some of the major factors and Delhi catered nicely to it.
    `,
      `Q. What would be your perspective on the culture of IIT, Delhi? 
    `,
      `Ans.- IIT Delhi is considered to be one of the premier institutes for multiple disciplines including management. The infrastructure of IIT Delhi is top-notch. The faculty have a meticulous understanding of the subjects they teach and know their practical application. Overall, learning with talented peers in such an environment fosters the growth and refinement of a person’s acumen.
    `,
      `Q. How was the shift from preparing for the Civil Services Examination to preparing for CAT and working in the management field?
    `,
      `Ans. - There is a major difference in approach in bureaucracy and management field. In management you have to network, you have to be able to shift attention in short bursts, and you need to have an understanding of social media and learn to use it effectively, all of which I was not used to. During your UPSC preparation, you isolate yourself, minimize your distractions, and focus the number of hours on your study.
    The perspective of a problem changes. As a UPSC aspirant, you tend to have an idealistic attitude concerned with the development of your constituency and people which you need to adjust while working in management. You have to adapt and learn from others. While some skills of UPSC like managing time, being updated, and learning new things every day can help you, however, you still have to acquire engaging communication skills and start visualizing things from a different perspective.
    Overall, being flexible helped me the most as I could adjust to the demands of a changed curriculum.

      `Nitish Jain is currently pursuing his MBA in International Business (IB) from IIFT, Kolkata. He completed his B.Sc. from Hospitality and Hotel Administration from Institute of Hotel Management, New Delhi. Prior joining to IIFT Kolkata he has worked as a Chef in French Embassy, Ahmedabad. He has also worked as a Facilities Manager in Shakambari Textiles for 1 year. He has also been a Finalist in multiple case competitions at National level and is currently leading the role of Junior Executive Member in Alumni Relations Committee. We had an interesting discussion with Nitish regarding his entire journey to IIFT and how is life now at IIFT for him.
    `,
      `Q. Hello Nitish, welcome to Peer Support! We are glad to have you with us on this interview session. Congratulations for IIFT. So why and when did you think of doing an MBA?
    `,
      `A. Thank You Peer Support for giving me this opportunity. After my bachelors I have joined as a Chef and then later joined as a Facility manager in Shakambari Textiles. But I have always wanted to open my own chain of restaurants. I was really excited to know the technical side of a business. What entails in the functioning and operation of any business. So, MBA provided me with an opportunity to learn these things in detail along with uplifting my career.
    `,
      `Q. That’s interesting. So, being in a job how did you manage your preparation for CAT and what was the strategy for IIFT in particular?
    `,
      `A. Well, from the beginning VARC was my strength. I wrote a mock for CAT and scored 92 percentile in the first attempt. Here I got an idea about my strengths and weaknesses in the CAT paper. I tried to maximize my results in the VARC section. For the other two, Quants was a bit tough for me as I was coming from non-maths background. I tried to read selectively for Quants. I tried to solve those sections which yield more marks first and then used to go to other sections. I have followed teachings of many faculties available over web. Then after giving multiple mocks, I started analyzing the area I need more focus on and gave my maximum time to it. On the CAT Day I messed up the LRDI section by doing a silly mistake but I had managed to perform well in the other two sections scoring 99+.
    Earlier IIFT used to conduct separate exam for them, but from this year they are going to take through CAT only.
    `,
      `Q. What do you think the cut-off will be for IIFT in accordance to CAT? Do you think there will be sectional cut-offs or will it be overall cut-offs?
    `,
      `A. As per my knowledge and after interaction with the admin team we can expect the sectional cut-off to be 70+ for all the sections and overall can go to 95-96+. Well, this figure can change a little bit depending on the results but the deviation can be pretty less.
    `,
      `Q. Tell us about your interview experience in IIFT? 
    `,
      `A. My interview revolved around the restaurant business about which I did mention in the beginning. They asked me about the technical side of the business like valuation, ratios related financial health, etc. Then they shifted to my work-experience and asked question regarding that. I was also asked to give an extempore on sustainability and ethics. Later they asked my stand on a controversial topic- Is profit maximization more important or maintaining the ethics in a business. 
    `,
      `Q. How is MBA in International Business (IB) different from that of the general MBA or is it on the similar lines as that to general MBA? And what is the general criteria for the course?
    `,
      `A. We have the MBA-IB as the flagship two-year course while our New Delhi campus is providing MBA in IB and Business Analytics. The topics for IB is nearly similar with that of general MBA but we have some additional courses like International Trade Operation and Logistics, International Marketing, Finance and Operations which adds the perspective of international trade and business along with the domestic side. Here you can expect learnings around shipping lines, custom offices, trading terminologies at international level and lot more.
    `,
      `Q. How is life now at IIFT? What sort of activities are you involved in and how do you manage your academics and social life?
    `,
      `A. IIFT is one of the most revered institutes in management among the corporates. We used to spend a major chunk of time in our class rooms in learning, decoding cases, working on our assignments and projects. Apart from that we indulge in many social activities, play games. We have all the sports facilities available in this 7-acre campus starting from badminton courts to a fully equipped gym. 
    The hostel facilities are really good. The boys are provided with single sharing rooms while three girls share a 2 BHK flat. 
    Regarding student activities we have a student driven Equity research fund driven by equity research cell. Here students make their own portfolio and invest money. So, the learnings are applied in real time space. Then E-cell hosts an incubator which guides and helps start-up enthusiasts. 
    `,
      ``,
      `Port Visits in IIFT: Port Visits are one of the most happening things in IIFT. We are selected to visit different ports around the world like Dubai, Singapore, Mumbai, etc. Here we get a hands-on experience to observe and learn trading activities in detail. How the port operates, what are the certificates, licenses and documents involved, the functioning of the customs department and lot more. 
    There used to be a social awareness program also for two weeks where students take part in various activities in the rural space and assess the situation and other challenges out there.
    `,
      `Q. The foreign word is quite prominent in IIFT, so what is situation of the exchange program in IIFT?
    `,
      `A. Students from both the campuses- New Delhi and Kolkata visit foreign universities during the last trimester. We have collaborations with 30+ universities around the world. Here the students have to complete the remaining credits of the trimester. It used to be an enriching experience for the students. 
    `,
      `Q. What are your future goals?`,
      `A. I want to start my own chain of restaurants. Well, I wish to open the First Michelin Star restaurant in India. Not sure if this will work out but looking forward for the same.

      `We had an engaging conversation with Sahil Gupta, currently pursuing his MBA at IIT Kanpur. Sahil completed his B.Tech from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla in the department of Chemical Engineering. Sahil worked as a System Engineer with TCS for over 3 years. He was a part of SunLife Insurance and the ICICI bank mobile app. We uncovered a fascinating narrative that traverses his background, CAT preparation and his subsequent transition into the world of business studies. Let's dive into the inspiring account of Sahil’s journey:
      `,
      `1.) Hey Sahil can you brief a little about yourself?
      `,
      `A.) Sahil hails from Sambalpur, Odisha and has completed his schooling and academics over there. He then joined BTech to complete his undergrads and passed out in the year 2020 from VSSUT, Burla with flying colours.
      `,
      `2.) Sahil, you were already into tech job at TCS, so when did you decide about CAT?
      `,
      `A.) Sahil's unwavering determination to pursue an MBA was germinated since his mother is also an Entrepreneur. He was pretty clear about appearing for CAT as he was experienced with managing multiple pipelines and started self-preparation along with his work.
      `,
      `3.) Sambit what are the resources you followed for CAT?
      `,
      `A.) I prepared the syllabus through books and other You-tube sources but went in to appear for a large number of mock tests online before my CAT exam. I used to analyse my mistakes and focussed on any 2 of the 3 sections to make most out of the exam.
      `,
      `4.) How was the CAT exam?`,
      `A.) I had appeared CAT once before so I was well prepared for the exam. I focussed onto completing the questions that could be solved in one go. Next, I went with my Quants and LRDI part as they were a bit easy to me compared to VARC. I had a good exam and I was sure about a good percentile, so I started preparing for the interviews.
      `,
      `5.) Sahil, what all colleges did you fill for MBA?
      `,
      `A.) I had filled almost filled all IIT’s and few IIM’s due to the sectional cut-off. The first college I was called up was IIM Rohtak and I couldn’t convert it. Next, I had a call from IIT Kanpur and I went in for the interview.
      `,
      `6.) Great, Sahil how was the interview and what type of questions did they ask?
      `,
      `A.) See IIT Kanpur takes 50% of your academics and other 50% from the GD round. So, we had a GD round that was based on the topic “Whether Government should go for Privatisation? “ . Generally, it is 1 minute to speak and 6 minutes of discussion. To add it may happen that the point you might have thought is taken up by someone so be ready with 2 or more points and if you don’t then you may extend the same by accounting him and adding your own details. 
      `,
      `7.) Sahil, well you were aware of the GD thing, how did you prepare for it?
      `,
      `A.) So, what I used to do is I used to follow the Editorial Analysis of Newspapers done on You-tube for the UPSC students. Even if you aren’t that confident with the GD topic, be ready with 5 latest happenings that you may relate to at times during the GD. Moreover, for the freshers do check-in some marketing concepts like 4P’s that may help you ace at interview.
      `,
      `8.) Sahil how’s the Start-up culture and Clubs scenario at IIT-K?
      `,
      `A.) Yah, we have a good number of emerging start-ups like Zepto whose founder is an alumnus of IIT-K. There is the E-cell that organises Product based Case Hackathons for students. We have our annual fests like Tech-Kriti and Udghosh to enjoy the B-school life. `,
      `9.) So Sahil can you shed light on the placement drive at IIT-K?
      `,
      `A.) Ok so we have 2 placement offices, one driven at the central level and the other by DoMS. There is a good no. of students who got handsome packages with an average of 18-20 LPA. Some of the giants of the nation like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Wells Fargo, Wave Maker and more visited this year and were delightful with the recruitment.
      `,
      `10.) Sahil what according to you are the USP’s of IIT-K?
      `,
      `A.) The first thing is the fees which ranges to just 4 lakhs compared to other B-schools. Next up is the IIT tag that helps you in the corporate sector and the ROI compared to other institutions. The pedagogy and the ecosystem here provide you with a rich learning experience and open multiple avenues to grow in the field of corporate or entrepreneurship. 
      `,
      `11.) Lastly, Sahil few advices to the readers out there?
      `,
      `A.) Practice mocks and find out what section works best for you. If you aren’t good at a particular section accept it and don’t let your ego to make you do mistakes in the exam. Believe in yourself and make the most out of it.

      `In an engaging conversation with Sambit Mohanty, currently pursuing his MBA at IIM Calcutta. Sambit completed his B.Tech from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla in the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. We uncovered a fascinating narrative that traverses his background, CAT preparation, his exam day, and his subsequent transition into the world of business studies. Let's dive into the inspiring account of Sambit's journey:`,
      `1.) Hey Sambit can you brief a little about yourself?
      `,
      `A.) Hello Everyone, I am Sambit Mohanty from Bhubaneswar. I have completed my schooling in Bhubaneswar before moving on to VSSUT Burla to complete my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Currently I am pursuing my MBA in IIM Calcutta.
      `,
      `2.) Sambit when did you decide about CAT?
      `,
      `A.) I was determined to pursue an MBA from an early stage. I was pretty clear about appearing for CAT and started preparing from the 3rd year itself.
      `,
      `3.) Sambit why CAT rather than MTech or placements?
      `,
      `A.) I have been surrounded by business men since my childhood days and always wanted to pursue this career. I had searched about various MBA colleges and IIM- CALCUTTA was something that I dreamt of achieving before appearing for CAT. Moreover, I wasn't much into the core field like many others as it didn't interest me a lot. To the placement scene, I was placed in campus at Deloitte and had my job offer near to a week after the CAT exam.
      `,
      `4.) Sambit what are the resources and off-line centres you went to prepared for CAT?`,
      `A.) I prepared the syllabus through books and other sources but went in to appear for a large number of mock tests online before my CAT exam. I used to analyse my time distribution and mistakes that were silly but could hand me bonus points in the actual exam. Moreover, I also practiced a timely slot of 2-4 p.m. for appearing mocks as it is the same time as the CAT exam that made my mind to be rightly effective for the exam.
      `,
      `5.) How was the D- day and the CAT exam?
      `,
      `A.) I was well prepared for the exam and moved on to my hometown to appear for the exam, had my exam in the 3rd session. With my other friends who had appeared in the 1st and 2nd session they had insights about a particular section like VARC or LRDI being tough. I went in with a blank mind as to do the best what comes on plate. I had a good exam and I was sure about a good percentile, so I started preparing for the GDPI round.
      `,
      `5.) How much of a gap did you have between your results and the GDPI round?`,
      `A.) I got an approximate gap of about 1.5 months in between my CAT results and my GD PI round.`,
      `6.) Sambit, what all colleges did you fill for MBA?
      `,
      `A.) I had filled almost all colleges and the first college I was called up was SPJIMR and I had converted it. Next, I had call from IIM-Calcultta and I went in for the GDPI Round.
      `,
      `7.) Great, Sambit how was the interview and what type of questions did they ask?
      `,
      `A.) The interview went pretty well as I could ease through the interview questions as they were similar to what I and my friends prepared for, they asked questions about my resume and similar questions to why MBA over other courses. But what made the interview a bit different was my interview with Prof. Nag, Gold medallist from IIT Madras who completed his Ph.D. from IIM-Calcutta who interviewed me on my undergraduate department where I could successfully deal the theory part but was not satisfactory at the numerical questions to which Prof. also understood my preparation was for in the last months and numerical was something I hadn’t practiced.
      `,
      `8.) And then, Sambit you were at IIM-C Congratulations! So, how’s life at IIM-C?
      `,
      `A.) Life’s been on a happier note to join my dream college. We have various project sessions often that encourage communication as well as placement opportunities. We had sessions with our Alumni’s that makes me feel how cool they were back then and even now. There’s a good amount of sports and extra activities to keep yourself engaged. Currently we are having an inter sports meet between IIM A, B & C at IIM-Bangalore. 
      `,
      `9.) Sambit any suggestions to the upcoming CAT aspirants?
      `,
      `A.) Practice a good number of mocks to analyse your weaker sections and make a good lot of friends who would not only help you for your exams but also keep motivating you to achieve greater heights.

      `1.) Good evening, Sandeep. My name is Shreya Swain, your interviewer from Peer Support for the day. Tell me a little about yourself.
      `,
      `A.)  Good evening, Shreya, my name is Sandeep Kumar Singh. Currently, I am pursuing my MBA in DoMS, IIT Madras. I have completed my B.Tech from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I used to work at Principal Global Services (PGS) after my bachelor's before Joining for an MBA degree.

      `,
      `2.) That’s impressive. What was the main reason behind the switch of careers from PGS to a full-term MBA degree?

      `,
      `A.)  Though I had received a well-paying job after my bachelor's degree, the prospect of a management course had always appealed to me. After I came across the idea of the CAT, I started preparing for it immediately. 
      One of my biggest motivations is my perseverance in management. I was leading the Students’ Cultural Association of my college. During that period, I got the opportunity to deal with multiple organizations regarding sponsorship and work with many teams to manage the event smoothly. I got a taste of management and wanted to explore it further from a broader perspective of corporate.
      
      `,
      `3.) How was the entire process of MBA selection in IITs?
      `,
      `A.) IITs generally roll out their form separately. After the declaration of CAT results, you can find the application link on their website. You have to give all the details regarding your profile. Then there they used to ask 3-4 questions based on your career goals, the objective of joining an MBA, and questions resembling your SOP.
      After you get shortlisted here, you will be called for the WAT/PI process which will be held at 5 different nodal centers. You can choose your center accordingly. The WAT revolves around general topics or current issues. For me, it was ‘How EV as Public transport can help in attaining sustainability’. Then you will be headed towards your Interview panel where you will be interviewed and then the final verdict comes up through your mail.
      
      `,
      `4.) Could you please mention some of your interview questions to our readers?`,
      `A.) Yes sure, my interview generally revolved around my work-ex. They asked me about my current company, their net worth, my role in detail, and our competitors. Then they asked about the technology I was working in and I mentioned it to be Salesforce. Then they started asking about Salesforce, how it operates, the different clouds, and who are the competitors of Salesforce. Then they asked some HR questions regarding why MBA despite having a job, which section you enjoyed the most in CAT, why is your VARC score not good, and which companies you are willing to join in placements. Some general questions around it like when I mentioned about Food Processing and Energy company they asked me to give some examples around it and asked for the reason behind choosing them.
      `,
      `5.)  How would you describe your experience as a student of MBA in IIT, Madras?
      `,
      `A.) Joining IITM is one of the best decisions I cherish in my life. Our batch size is 94 students from different backgrounds with different levels of experience. This gives you a variety of minds to interact with. The course curriculum is very structured and application-oriented. We have some of the best faculties at the world level you can say who are expert in their domain and being a small size batch the one-on-one interaction with them in and outside class is very fruitful. Starting from learning the theory to applying it in various case studies and projects gives a wholesome experience. Further, we used to have industry connects on a weekly basis where you get to learn from business leaders.
      Coming to the fun part the department comes together to celebrate and enjoy. Starting from auctions and sports tournaments we celebrate many festivals with pomp and show.
      The IIT ecosystem adds the cherry to the top. We have one of the biggest Incubation centers where you can apply to incubate your startup when the cohort opens. You get a chance to interact with some of the best minds of our nation and work with them on their projects and events. Many workshops and sessions are lined up every weekend to enrich your knowledge and experience.
      
      `,
      `6.)  What are your plans after completing your MBA?
      `,
      `A.) : I am looking forward to growing and elevating my career in the corporate domain. `,

      `In an engaging conversation with Ankit Aryan, currently pursuing his MBA at IIM Kashipur. Ankit completed his B.A. Hons. in English from Amity University, Noida. Ankit worked closely with Aero-Wings a Drone Start-up based out of Patna that looks after illicit liquor supply in Bihar. We uncovered a fascinating narrative that traverses his background, CAT preparation, and his subsequent transition into the world of business studies. Let's dive into the inspiring account of Ankit's journey:`,
      `Q. Hello Ankit, can you brief me a little about yourself?
      `,
      `A.) Ankit hails from Patna, Bihar, and has completed his schooling and academics over there. He then joined B.A. in English to complete his undergrads and passed out in the year 2022 from Amity University with flying colors. He then worked for six months with a drone-based start-up Aerowings Technologies and coordinated with the excise department.

      `,
      `Q. Ankit this question might have popped up in every interview you gave, so once again, why an MBA when you were already into a decent job at Aero-Wings and had undergrads in English Honours? Moreover, students with English Honours have an inclination toward UPSC, so what’s your take on that?

      `,
      `A.) Yeah, that’s well directed, I did think of UPSC but what made me pause was my age, which was 25 at that time and UPSC students need to have rigorous practice over years before taking the exams which I didn’t.  Moreover, students with a B.A. degree would end up with an M.A. and then go for a lectureship which didn’t inspire me a lot. But I love English and I do read novels in my spare time. Finally, an MBA has a better job aspect in the present market so I decided to pursue it.
      
      `,
      `Q. How did you manage your job as well as your preparation for CAT?

      `Ans) My preparation was not easy at all. Initially, I was at my college and managing preparation with my academics was way too difficult. Even, at my work it was not a purely nine-to-five job as I was in the start-up field. I used to get calls at 10 or 11 PM for work. Sometimes I had to travel to different districts but I got the support from my family and friends. They backed me in my tough times which eventually helped me in my preparation.
      
      `,
      `Q. What are the resources you followed for CAT?`,
      `A.) I completed my honors and came home on 20th May 2022 and then I took admission at Career Forum, Patna along with having my job side-by-side. I used to have offline coaching 5 days a week from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Moreover, I have watched videos of Rodha, Bala Subramanian of the 2-IIM and Crack-U Previous Year Question series. I was fortunate enough that I got a good set of teachers who helped me every time I had a doubt. I used to give offline mocks and scored a good percentile in all sets. Also, since I hadn’t solved Maths for a long time, I put in some extra effort to get through it.
      `,
      `Q. How was the CAT exam?
      `,
      `A.) See, the CAT exam is very unpredictable as it is conducted in different slots. So I appeared in Slot-1 in 2022 which is by far the most difficult paper set for CAT, & what happened with me is I was pretty confident about my VARC section. Even in the mocks I used to score 98 or 99 percentile but on D-day it didn’t favour me and made some silly mistakes losing up marks and ended up with a 96 percentile in CAT.
      
      `,
      `Q. Ankit, from what colleges did you get a call?

      `,
      `A.) I had filled almost all IIM’s and IIT’s. I didn’t have a call from the BLACKI & The first college I was called up to was IIM Shillong and I converted it. Next, I had a call for the IIM-CAP application and I went in for the interview. I have converted SCMHRD, NMIMS Mumbai, IIM Kashipur, IIM Sirmaur, and IIM Nagpur. `,
      `Q. Great, Ankit how was your interview in these colleges and what type of questions did they ask?`,
      `A.) See IIM-CAP provides you with an application that is divided into 2 sections, one is Achievements subdivided into Extra-Curricular and Co-Curricular and the other is Hobbies. So generally, they frame questions out of these. 
      Regarding experience, I had different experiences in different interviews:
      SCMHRD- It completely revolved around my work experience.
      SIBM- Since I was from Amity University, Noida campus they asked my take on the freebies as that time ‘freebies’ was a hot topic in Delhi.
      IIM Shillong- Hailing from Bihar, they have asked me about Nitish Kumar and also asked why good Orthopaedic doctors hail from Bihar.
      NMIMS- This was a pressure interview for me. They asked why I chose English honors despite not having excellent marks in English.
      They grilled me by asking, since you are not much in mathematics, how come you handle the analytics in an MBA. Then they asked Why an MBA. The purpose of this interview is to assess how calm and well-composed you are in answering stressful questions.
      IIM CAP: What is the currency of Syria?
      If the parents are in business, why not business, and why MBA?
      A couple of Math questions on Compound Interest. Current affairs and my goal 5 years down the lane. What have you learned in English hons. and how is this gonna help you in your MBA?
      There were graduation-based questions on subjects. Since I have mentioned gymming as my hobby, they asked me the difference between Weightlifting and Powerlifting.
      `,
      `Q. What will be your suggestions to the aspirants regarding the PI thing?`,
      `Ans. Interviews are unpredictable. I would suggest everyone to prepare ample no. of mocks may it be with an institute or with your peers preparing for the same. Do prepare for your extracurriculars, current affairs, work experience, undergraduate subjects, the specialization you are looking for in an MBA & hobbies. Also, when mentioning specialization do a bit of research on it, because they might ask questions about it.`,
      `Q.  Well Ankit, how did you prepare for the PI thing?`,
      `A.) For GDPI I have taken help from TIME Patna. There I used to attend their sessions and ask all my queries. I and my friends used to take a mock interview among us. The one who is going for an interview next becomes an interviewee and the others become the interviewers. Then we used to ask a variety of questions along with discussing the answers. Since, every second a new thing happens in this world and it is practically impossible for you to take note of it, so through discussions, you can cover it.`,
      `Q.  Ankit, how’s the Start-up culture and Clubs scenario at IIM-Kashipur?`,
      `A.) Yeah, we have a very good start-up culture over here with an event named Uthistha where 400-500 start-ups will come and showcase their projects and the top 10 will be funded by the Uttarakhand Government in association with IIM-K. To the club thing yes like other colleges there are various sports as well as co-curricular clubs for the students to relax after a busy schedule.
      `,
      `Q. So, Ankit can you shed light on the internships and what are your goals?`,
      `A.) Indeed we have good companies providing decent internships to the students, and it starts from just 15-20 days after your admissions. The competition is high and you have to be ready to grab any opportunity that comes your way. I am very much interested in Finance and looking forward to making my career in it.
      `,
      `Q. Lastly, Ankit your piece of advice to the readers out there?
      `,
      `A.) See, we always say Mocks are a mirror to the real exam and that indeed is but you can never predict the CAT exam. Try to solve a good number of mocks and take part in discussions with your peers. On the D-Day or during the Interview, go with a fresh mind and if at any point you feel that you have made some mistakes in any part, don’t get stuck and focus on the future sections ahead.`,
      `Cheers, to all of you to have patiently read the conversation between our member and Ankit. We will very soon be releasing an article pertaining to the IIM-CAP process. What are some other questions that crossed your mind and needed to be answered? Do drop below as we would curate them for you. We post interviews of various MBA graduates.

      `In an engaging conversation with Vaishnavi, currently pursuing her MBA at FMS Delhi. Vaishnavi completed her Bachelor of Capital Markets from the Bombay Stock Exchange Institute, Mumbai. Vaishnavi worked closely with Morningstar, based out of Mumbai as a Research Analyst. We uncovered a fascinating narrative that traverses her background, CAT preparation, and her subsequent transition into the world of business studies. Let's dive into the inspiring account of Vaishnavi's journey:`,
      `Q.) Hey Vaishnavi, can you briefly describe yourself?`,
      `A.) Vaishnavi hails from Mumbai and has completed her schooling and academics over there. She then joined the Bombay Stock Exchange Institute to complete her Bachelor’s in capital markets and passed out in the year 2020 with flying colors.`,
      `Q.) Vaishnavi this question might have popped up in every interview you have attended, yet why an MBA when you were already into a decent job at Morningstar?`,
      `A.) See, MBA was in the back of my mind as I always wanted to know the business side of the financial knowledge that I had gained in my bachelor's. At Morningstar, I was working as a Data Research Analyst which dealt majorly with the technical side. So I decided to appear for the CAT and pursue an MBA to assist me in exploring the different aspects of Finance.`,
      `Q.) What are the resources you followed for CAT?`,
      `A.) I used a lot of online resources, and books, and took materials of classes that were available online for free. For the mock series, I referred to the IMS mock series which proved to be very helpful. I was always good at the VARC and DI part but I had to improve my Quants and with Mocks I analyzed my mistakes and prepared for the D-day.`,
      `Q.) How was the CAT exam?`,
      `A.)I was very good at VARC and LRDI but Quants was my weaker section. However, I tried to devote equal importance to all three sections with some special attention to Quants. On the exam day, VARC and LRDI went pretty well for me, however, I got stuck with QA. The overall result was nice and I got selected for FMS.
      `,
      `Q.) Vaishnavi, from which all colleges did you get a call?`,
      `A.) I got a call from FMS, IIM Indore, IIM CAP, and other IIMs except for IIM B, C, A, L, and K.
      `,
      `Q.) Great, Vaishnavi, how was your interview experience in different colleges?`,
      `A.) See, in most of the other Interviews, the questions revolved around my work at Morningstar, the generic question of Why MBA, my role as a financial analyst in Morningstar, and since Morningstar is a US company, they asked about terminologies that are used in the US and its analogous terminology in India
      `,
      ``,
      `Well for the FMS, it was different. They did not ask me any questions about my work experience.  They had my career mark sheets and asked me about my bachelor subjects, and some personality-based questions. FMS has this 1 min Extempore talk on a topic they provide you. Moreover, they asked me questions on Excel functions, which I answered confidently even if not all of them were correct. If you don’t know any answer, try to be calm and handle it with confidence. 
      `,
      `Q.) Alright Vaishnavi, How is life now at FMS?`,
      `A.) FMS doesn’t provide hostel facilities, so you can get your PG or flat within in 2 KM radius of the college. We start our day with 9 AM classes and the classes continue till 4 PM. Along with that, we have many other activities like Case Competitions, Projects, Guest lectures, and the very important one- SIP preparation. Life used to be hectic as well as fun filled with lots of learning.`,
      `Q.) Vaishnavi, FMS is known as the Mecca of Marketing. Could you detail the USPs of FMS?`,
      `A.) Yeah, sure. FMS is considered to be among the Top B-Schools in India and the world for Marketing. However, being my major in Finance I can say that you also get a very good exposure for finance with Investment Banking and Corporate Finance roles. `,
      ``,
      `For promoting Entrepreneurship, FMS has a very interesting Placement holiday policy where you can start your venture by deferring placements. They give you a time of 2 years. In these two years, if you can establish your own business and start earning profits then you can continue with it. However, if you are not successful you can come after two years to the college to sit for placements. Moreover, the ROI of FMS is the highest among other top B-schools.`,
      `Q.) What are Your future goals and where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?`,
      `A.) I would like to upscale myself and pursue my career in either investment banking or corporate finance down the lane.`,
      `Q.) Surely! Wish you all the best for that and before ending this session, Your words of wisdom for the readers out there?`,
      `A.) Prepare consistently for all three sections as you might land in problems if your favorite section gets tough on exam day. Moreover, give plenty number of mocks. Even if you have not completed the syllabus, do give mocks to know the type and pattern of questions you can expect in the examination. While nearing the exam, try to increase the number of mocks and start analyzing them. Wishing everyone all the best for their preparation. `,

      `In an engaging conversation with Sujeet Chaubey, currently pursuing his MBA at IIM Bodhgaya. Sujeet hails from Varanasi and has completed his graduation in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Mumbai. Sujeet worked as a Solar Engineer at Panasonic before joining as a Renewable Energy Consultant at Becquer Energy. He joined IIM Bodhgaya in the year 2022, however, how cracking CAT along with a job schedule was very challenging for him. So let’s hear from Sujeet how he managed to do it.`,
      `Q. Hello Sujeet, Good Evening. I am Rajiv from Peer Support. We heartily welcome you to Peer Support for the ‘Road to MBA’ talk. So let’s start with a brief introduction about yourself.
      `,
      `A.) Sujeet hails from Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, and has completed his schooling and academics from Mumbai. He completed his graduation in Mechanical Engineering and passed out in the year 2018 from the University of Mumbai. He then worked with Panasonic for 16 months as a Solar Engineer and then joined Becquer Energy as a Renewable Energy Consultant. Becquer Energy is a Singapore-based energy firm and being a consultant Sujeet has to work directly with clients based inside and outside of India. After that, he joined IIM Bodhgaya in 2022.`,
      `Q. When and Why did you decide to join an MBA?`,
      `A.) My job as a consultant gave me a better understanding of a company's Financial and strategic aspects. I thought of delving more into this field and wanted to learn management. There I decided to go for a full-time MBA. I wrote my first attempt at CAT in 2020. I took a crash course from Elites Grid for 3 months for preparation and followed mocks from TIME. I secured a 98.5 percentile. I was very optimistic about converting only BLACKIS but only got calls for the elite program of IIM Kozhikode and IIM Lucknow. I appeared for the second time in 2021 and secured 97.5 percentile. I have received my first call from IIM Vizag and then my CAP call.
      `,
      `Q. How was your interview experience for both years?`,
      `A.) Let me start with the recent one:`,
      ``,
      `CAP interview experience:`,
      ``,
      `The interview was online as we were at the end zone of the COVID. They asked me questions about COVID. Then my entire interview revolved around Renewable energy- How renewable energy is going to help India, and what we were doing as a company.`,
      ``,
      `Then they shifted to my resume and asked questions on the different pointers mentioned. I have also faced some questions about academics. Being a Mechanical Engineer I was asked about Entropy and thermodynamics.`,
      ``,
      `Then they asked me whether I would repeat CAT to which I replied with a smile that I was done with this exam and interview things.`,
      ``,
      `Past- Interview Experience:`,
      ``,
      `Since I have mentioned about Marathon, they asked me questions about what type of marathon I have done and they even asked about the Current affairs based out of marathons. As the TCS marathon has happened recently, they even asked about that too. Then the interview revolved around my work-ex and the pointers mentioned in the application form.`,
      `Q.) That was insightful. We saw your profile and observed that you have won many case competitions and have also been a finalist in some of them. So what used to be your strategy around case competitions?`,
      `A.) Ok first of all I used to segregate in all the competitions I wanted to take part in. There used to be 120 corporate case competitions every year and I generally take part in corporate case competitions. From the 120 we used to be eligible in 38+ case competitions, from which I used to select 16-17 based on my skillset. I also used to take care that no two case competitions collide in their timeline.
      `,
      ``,
      `Then I try to get a good team and make sure to give my best in the completion of the activities.`,
      ``,
      `The first round used to be a Quiz round and we used to solve it as a Team. This used to be an easy part. Then comes the round of PPTs. Here you have very little time to grab the attention of the evaluator. So you have to focus on some strategies like going with the color code of the company, keeping visible fonts, and use of data and logic with interpretations instead of writing long passages.
      `,
      ``,
      `In the final round, you will have time and platform to put down your perspective and utilize this to the maximum to share your viewpoint.`,
      `Q.) Learned a lot about case competitions now, thank you! So now how is life at IIM Bodhgaya?
      `,
      `A.) IIM Bodhgaya offers a diverse range of courses. Along with core MBA, we have Digital Business Management(DBM) and Hospital and Health care management (HHM) students with us. We have also this IPM program along with Ph.D. programs. So we get to interact and learn with people from diverse backgrounds. `,
      ``,
      `Bodhgaya is one of the prime locations in Bihar and it is growing at a rapid rate. We are also tying up various PSUs, and the Bihar government to work on multiple projects.
      `,
      ``,
      `We have our academic, cultural, and sports committees as used to be in regular B-Schools. Our annual fest Elegante just completed its 6th edition. Even if the weather is extreme the campus used to be lively and active every time with various activities.`,
      `Q.) How was your preparation strategy and what would you suggest to our readers regarding the CAT preparation and interviews?
      `,
      
      `A.) My preparation schedule used to be very erratic because of my job. I have to attend multiple meetings along with international trips. But I used to take out my time to prepare 2-3 hours on the basics. I have taken a crash course from Elites Grid and have subscribed for TIME mocks. I used to analyze mocks to know my strengths and weaknesses. I would suggest giving an ample amount of mocks and analyzing them. `,
      ``,
      `For the interview, I took the help of two of my seniors from TISS and SPJIMR who used to guide me and also helped me with my mock interviews. I would suggest preparing Extracurriculars, Work ex, Undergraduate subjects, Current affairs, and hobbies. You can also mention your interest in any Specialisation. However, when mentioning Specialisation do a bit of research on it, because that might favor you or backfire you.
