      ``,
      `Q. Good morning Apurva, we are contacting you from Peer Support. How have you been?
    `,
      `Ans. Good morning to you too, I’ve been doing well.
    `,
      `Q. Tell us more about yourself.
    `,
      `Ans. My name is Apurva Tidke. I am from Nagpur. I did my early schooling back in Nagpur, further, I pursued my engineering degree in Computer Science from KITS College.  After that I started preparing for UPSC Civil Services Examination. I have devoted 7 years of my life preparing for UPSC. During this period I have also worked in a company called Cactus Communications where I edited research papers from all over the globe. I am inclined towards literature and content from the beginning and have published a novel. After my stint with Cactus, I started working as a VARC trainer. I taught VARC at TIME Ludhiana and then joined Tarkashastra (Pune) as the Study Abroad Head. During COVID years I worked as a mentor for UPSC aspirants on an online platform.
 
    `,
      `Q. You have mentioned something regarding publishing a novel, could you shed some light on that aspect?`,
      `Ans. Yes, I am a published novelist. I have written a novel called ‘Fantasy Girl’ which explores the themes of patriarchy and women's role in society where I have tried to offer a nuanced perspective with respect to how injustice against women is a societal issue, not an individual woman’s issue.`,
      `Q. Being a married woman as well as a working professional, how did you manage CAT preparation along with your family and job?
    `,
      `Ans. As I have mentioned VARC has been one of my strengths. I tried to capitalize as much as possible in this section and manage the other two. For LRDI and Quants, I followed Arun Sharma’s books. Here I applied a selective approach of choosing the sections yielding more questions in CAT. I tried to focus more on them. I used to give mocks regularly although the frequency used to get hampered due to exhaustion from non-academic areas. While giving mocks I used to attempt maximum questions in VARC and select the easier and moderate questions in LRDI and Quants. After every mock, the most important part is to analyze them. If I faced any difficulty in any subject or regarding any preparation, I approached my colleagues or friends and asked for help. They have always motivated, helped, and guided me throughout this journey.
    `,
      `Q5. How tough was the interview for different IITs? What were some of the intriguing questions that were asked to you?
    `,
      `Ans. The interview approach differs for different colleges. In IIT Madras, the interview was subject-oriented where I was asked questions related to statistics and other subjects. The interview for IIT Delhi was personality-oriented, where they asked me questions related to my published novel and my work experience. They began with HR questions like why MBA, and future goals. Then they asked:
    -        What was the thought process involved in writing the novel?
    -        How work experience helped me become a better person and what qualities did I pick up from it?
    -        Since you have completed long back do you look at yourself as an engineer?
     
    `,
      `Q. Why IIT Delhi?
    `,
      `Ans: IIT Delhi is one of the top-notch B-schools in the country which is consistently growing. This itself opens multiple opportunities in the sphere of management. Apart from my inclination towards literature and content, I have an interest in technology. In my work experience, I used to edit research articles. The technical bent motivated me to pursue my MBA from an ecosystem providing management knowledge with exposure to technology. Location and connectivity are also some of the major factors and Delhi catered nicely to it.
    `,
      `Q. What would be your perspective on the culture of IIT, Delhi? 
    `,
      `Ans.- IIT Delhi is considered to be one of the premier institutes for multiple disciplines including management. The infrastructure of IIT Delhi is top-notch. The faculty have a meticulous understanding of the subjects they teach and know their practical application. Overall, learning with talented peers in such an environment fosters the growth and refinement of a person’s acumen.
    `,
      `Q. How was the shift from preparing for the Civil Services Examination to preparing for CAT and working in the management field?
    `,
      `Ans. - There is a major difference in approach in bureaucracy and management field. In management you have to network, you have to be able to shift attention in short bursts, and you need to have an understanding of social media and learn to use it effectively, all of which I was not used to. During your UPSC preparation, you isolate yourself, minimize your distractions, and focus the number of hours on your study.
    The perspective of a problem changes. As a UPSC aspirant, you tend to have an idealistic attitude concerned with the development of your constituency and people which you need to adjust while working in management. You have to adapt and learn from others. While some skills of UPSC like managing time, being updated, and learning new things every day can help you, however, you still have to acquire engaging communication skills and start visualizing things from a different perspective.
    Overall, being flexible helped me the most as I could adjust to the demands of a changed curriculum.

    `Nitish Jain is currently pursuing his MBA in International Business (IB) from IIFT, Kolkata. He completed his B.Sc. from Hospitality and Hotel Administration from Institute of Hotel Management, New Delhi. Prior joining to IIFT Kolkata he has worked as a Chef in French Embassy, Ahmedabad. He has also worked as a Facilities Manager in Shakambari Textiles for 1 year. He has also been a Finalist in multiple case competitions at National level and is currently leading the role of Junior Executive Member in Alumni Relations Committee. We had an interesting discussion with Nitish regarding his entire journey to IIFT and how is life now at IIFT for him.
    `,
    `Q. Hello Nitish, welcome to Peer Support! We are glad to have you with us on this interview session. Congratulations for IIFT. So why and when did you think of doing an MBA?
    `,
    `A. Thank You Peer Support for giving me this opportunity. After my bachelors I have joined as a Chef and then later joined as a Facility manager in Shakambari Textiles. But I have always wanted to open my own chain of restaurants. I was really excited to know the technical side of a business. What entails in the functioning and operation of any business. So, MBA provided me with an opportunity to learn these things in detail along with uplifting my career.
    `,
    `Q. That’s interesting. So, being in a job how did you manage your preparation for CAT and what was the strategy for IIFT in particular?
    `,
    `A. Well, from the beginning VARC was my strength. I wrote a mock for CAT and scored 92 percentile in the first attempt. Here I got an idea about my strengths and weaknesses in the CAT paper. I tried to maximize my results in the VARC section. For the other two, Quants was a bit tough for me as I was coming from non-maths background. I tried to read selectively for Quants. I tried to solve those sections which yield more marks first and then used to go to other sections. I have followed teachings of many faculties available over web. Then after giving multiple mocks, I started analyzing the area I need more focus on and gave my maximum time to it. On the CAT Day I messed up the LRDI section by doing a silly mistake but I had managed to perform well in the other two sections scoring 99+.
    Earlier IIFT used to conduct separate exam for them, but from this year they are going to take through CAT only.
    `,
    `Q. What do you think the cut-off will be for IIFT in accordance to CAT? Do you think there will be sectional cut-offs or will it be overall cut-offs?
    `,
    `A. As per my knowledge and after interaction with the admin team we can expect the sectional cut-off to be 70+ for all the sections and overall can go to 95-96+. Well, this figure can change a little bit depending on the results but the deviation can be pretty less.
    `,
    `Q. Tell us about your interview experience in IIFT? 
    `,
    `A. My interview revolved around the restaurant business about which I did mention in the beginning. They asked me about the technical side of the business like valuation, ratios related financial health, etc. Then they shifted to my work-experience and asked question regarding that. I was also asked to give an extempore on sustainability and ethics. Later they asked my stand on a controversial topic- Is profit maximization more important or maintaining the ethics in a business. 
    `,
    `Q. How is MBA in International Business (IB) different from that of the general MBA or is it on the similar lines as that to general MBA? And what is the general criteria for the course?
    `,
    `A. We have the MBA-IB as the flagship two-year course while our New Delhi campus is providing MBA in IB and Business Analytics. The topics for IB is nearly similar with that of general MBA but we have some additional courses like International Trade Operation and Logistics, International Marketing, Finance and Operations which adds the perspective of international trade and business along with the domestic side. Here you can expect learnings around shipping lines, custom offices, trading terminologies at international level and lot more.
    `,
    `Q. How is life now at IIFT? What sort of activities are you involved in and how do you manage your academics and social life?
    `,
    `A. IIFT is one of the most revered institutes in management among the corporates. We used to spend a major chunk of time in our class rooms in learning, decoding cases, working on our assignments and projects. Apart from that we indulge in many social activities, play games. We have all the sports facilities available in this 7-acre campus starting from badminton courts to a fully equipped gym. 
    The hostel facilities are really good. The boys are provided with single sharing rooms while three girls share a 2 BHK flat. 
    Regarding student activities we have a student driven Equity research fund driven by equity research cell. Here students make their own portfolio and invest money. So, the learnings are applied in real time space. Then E-cell hosts an incubator which guides and helps start-up enthusiasts. 
    `,
    ``,
    `Port Visits in IIFT: Port Visits are one of the most happening things in IIFT. We are selected to visit different ports around the world like Dubai, Singapore, Mumbai, etc. Here we get a hands-on experience to observe and learn trading activities in detail. How the port operates, what are the certificates, licenses and documents involved, the functioning of the customs department and lot more. 
    There used to be a social awareness program also for two weeks where students take part in various activities in the rural space and assess the situation and other challenges out there.
    `,
    `Q. The foreign word is quite prominent in IIFT, so what is situation of the exchange program in IIFT?
    `,
    `A. Students from both the campuses- New Delhi and Kolkata visit foreign universities during the last trimester. We have collaborations with 30+ universities around the world. Here the students have to complete the remaining credits of the trimester. It used to be an enriching experience for the students. 
    `,
    `Q. What are your future goals?`,
    `A. I want to start my own chain of restaurants. Well, I wish to open the First Michelin Star restaurant in India. Not sure if this will work out but looking forward for the same.

      `We had an engaging conversation with Sahil Gupta, currently pursuing his MBA at IIT Kanpur. Sahil completed his B.Tech from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla in the department of Chemical Engineering. Sahil worked as a System Engineer with TCS for over 3 years. He was a part of SunLife Insurance and the ICICI bank mobile app. We uncovered a fascinating narrative that traverses his background, CAT preparation and his subsequent transition into the world of business studies. Let's dive into the inspiring account of Sahil’s journey:
      `,
      `1.) Hey Sahil can you brief a little about yourself?
      `,
      `A.) Sahil hails from Sambalpur, Odisha and has completed his schooling and academics over there. He then joined BTech to complete his undergrads and passed out in the year 2020 from VSSUT, Burla with flying colours.
      `,
      `2.) Sahil, you were already into tech job at TCS, so when did you decide about CAT?
      `,
      `A.) Sahil's unwavering determination to pursue an MBA was germinated since his mother is also an Entrepreneur. He was pretty clear about appearing for CAT as he was experienced with managing multiple pipelines and started self-preparation along with his work.
      `,
      `3.) Sambit what are the resources you followed for CAT?
      `,
      `A.) I prepared the syllabus through books and other You-tube sources but went in to appear for a large number of mock tests online before my CAT exam. I used to analyse my mistakes and focussed on any 2 of the 3 sections to make most out of the exam.
      `,
      `4.) How was the CAT exam?`,
      `A.) I had appeared CAT once before so I was well prepared for the exam. I focussed onto completing the questions that could be solved in one go. Next, I went with my Quants and LRDI part as they were a bit easy to me compared to VARC. I had a good exam and I was sure about a good percentile, so I started preparing for the interviews.
      `,
      `5.) Sahil, what all colleges did you fill for MBA?
      `,
      `A.) I had filled almost filled all IIT’s and few IIM’s due to the sectional cut-off. The first college I was called up was IIM Rohtak and I couldn’t convert it. Next, I had a call from IIT Kanpur and I went in for the interview.
      `,
      `6.) Great, Sahil how was the interview and what type of questions did they ask?
      `,
      `A.) See IIT Kanpur takes 50% of your academics and other 50% from the GD round. So, we had a GD round that was based on the topic “Whether Government should go for Privatisation? “ . Generally, it is 1 minute to speak and 6 minutes of discussion. To add it may happen that the point you might have thought is taken up by someone so be ready with 2 or more points and if you don’t then you may extend the same by accounting him and adding your own details. 
      `,
      `7.) Sahil, well you were aware of the GD thing, how did you prepare for it?
      `,
      `A.) So, what I used to do is I used to follow the Editorial Analysis of Newspapers done on You-tube for the UPSC students. Even if you aren’t that confident with the GD topic, be ready with 5 latest happenings that you may relate to at times during the GD. Moreover, for the freshers do check-in some marketing concepts like 4P’s that may help you ace at interview.
      `,
      `8.) Sahil how’s the Start-up culture and Clubs scenario at IIT-K?
      `,
      `A.) Yah, we have a good number of emerging start-ups like Zepto whose founder is an alumnus of IIT-K. There is the E-cell that organises Product based Case Hackathons for students. We have our annual fests like Tech-Kriti and Udghosh to enjoy the B-school life. `,
      `9.) So Sahil can you shed light on the placement drive at IIT-K?
      `,
      `A.) Ok so we have 2 placement offices, one driven at the central level and the other by DoMS. There is a good no. of students who got handsome packages with an average of 18-20 LPA. Some of the giants of the nation like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Wells Fargo, Wave Maker and more visited this year and were delightful with the recruitment.
      `,
      `10.) Sahil what according to you are the USP’s of IIT-K?
      `,
      `A.) The first thing is the fees which ranges to just 4 lakhs compared to other B-schools. Next up is the IIT tag that helps you in the corporate sector and the ROI compared to other institutions. The pedagogy and the ecosystem here provide you with a rich learning experience and open multiple avenues to grow in the field of corporate or entrepreneurship. 
      `,
      `11.) Lastly, Sahil few advices to the readers out there?
      `,
      `A.) Practice mocks and find out what section works best for you. If you aren’t good at a particular section accept it and don’t let your ego to make you do mistakes in the exam. Believe in yourself and make the most out of it.

      `In an engaging conversation with Sambit Mohanty, currently pursuing his MBA at IIM Calcutta. Sambit completed his B.Tech from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla in the department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. We uncovered a fascinating narrative that traverses his background, CAT preparation, his exam day, and his subsequent transition into the world of business studies. Let's dive into the inspiring account of Sambit's journey:`,
      `1.) Hey Sambit can you brief a little about yourself?
      `,
      `A.) Hello Everyone, I am Sambit Mohanty from Bhubaneswar. I have completed my schooling in Bhubaneswar before moving on to VSSUT Burla to complete my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Currently I am pursuing my MBA in IIM Calcutta.
      `,
      `2.) Sambit when did you decide about CAT?
      `,
      `A.) I was determined to pursue an MBA from an early stage. I was pretty clear about appearing for CAT and started preparing from the 3rd year itself.
      `,
      `3.) Sambit why CAT rather than MTech or placements?
      `,
      `A.) I have been surrounded by business men since my childhood days and always wanted to pursue this career. I had searched about various MBA colleges and IIM- CALCUTTA was something that I dreamt of achieving before appearing for CAT. Moreover, I wasn't much into the core field like many others as it didn't interest me a lot. To the placement scene, I was placed in campus at Deloitte and had my job offer near to a week after the CAT exam.
      `,
      `4.) Sambit what are the resources and off-line centres you went to prepared for CAT?`,
      `A.) I prepared the syllabus through books and other sources but went in to appear for a large number of mock tests online before my CAT exam. I used to analyse my time distribution and mistakes that were silly but could hand me bonus points in the actual exam. Moreover, I also practiced a timely slot of 2-4 p.m. for appearing mocks as it is the same time as the CAT exam that made my mind to be rightly effective for the exam.
      `,
      `5.) How was the D- day and the CAT exam?
      `,
      `A.) I was well prepared for the exam and moved on to my hometown to appear for the exam, had my exam in the 3rd session. With my other friends who had appeared in the 1st and 2nd session they had insights about a particular section like VARC or LRDI being tough. I went in with a blank mind as to do the best what comes on plate. I had a good exam and I was sure about a good percentile, so I started preparing for the GDPI round.
      `,
      `5.) How much of a gap did you have between your results and the GDPI round?`,
      `A.) I got an approximate gap of about 1.5 months in between my CAT results and my GD PI round.`,
      `6.) Sambit, what all colleges did you fill for MBA?
      `,
      `A.) I had filled almost all colleges and the first college I was called up was SPJIMR and I had converted it. Next, I had call from IIM-Calcultta and I went in for the GDPI Round.
      `,
      `7.) Great, Sambit how was the interview and what type of questions did they ask?
      `,
      `A.) The interview went pretty well as I could ease through the interview questions as they were similar to what I and my friends prepared for, they asked questions about my resume and similar questions to why MBA over other courses. But what made the interview a bit different was my interview with Prof. Nag, Gold medallist from IIT Madras who completed his Ph.D. from IIM-Calcutta who interviewed me on my undergraduate department where I could successfully deal the theory part but was not satisfactory at the numerical questions to which Prof. also understood my preparation was for in the last months and numerical was something I hadn’t practiced.
      `,
      `8.) And then, Sambit you were at IIM-C Congratulations! So, how’s life at IIM-C?
      `,
      `A.) Life’s been on a happier note to join my dream college. We have various project sessions often that encourage communication as well as placement opportunities. We had sessions with our Alumni’s that makes me feel how cool they were back then and even now. There’s a good amount of sports and extra activities to keep yourself engaged. Currently we are having an inter sports meet between IIM A, B & C at IIM-Bangalore. 
      `,
      `9.) Sambit any suggestions to the upcoming CAT aspirants?
      `,
      `A.) Practice a good number of mocks to analyse your weaker sections and make a good lot of friends who would not only help you for your exams but also keep motivating you to achieve greater heights.

Let's dive into the inspiring account of Sambit's journey:`,
      `1.) Good evening, Sandeep. My name is Shreya Swain, your interviewer from Peer Support for the day. Tell me a little about yourself.
      `,
      `A.)  Good evening, Shreya, my name is Sandeep Kumar Singh. Currently, I am pursuing my MBA in DoMS, IIT Madras. I have completed my B.Tech from Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla from the Department of Electrical Engineering. I used to work at Principal Global Services (PGS) after my bachelor's before Joining for an MBA degree.

      `,
      `2.) That’s impressive. What was the main reason behind the switch of careers from PGS to a full-term MBA degree?

      `,
      `A.)  Though I had received a well-paying job after my bachelor's degree, the prospect of a management course had always appealed to me. After I came across the idea of the CAT, I started preparing for it immediately. 
      One of my biggest motivations is my perseverance in management. I was leading the Students’ Cultural Association of my college. During that period, I got the opportunity to deal with multiple organizations regarding sponsorship and work with many teams to manage the event smoothly. I got a taste of management and wanted to explore it further from a broader perspective of corporate.
      
      `,
      `3.) How was the entire process of MBA selection in IITs?
      `,
      `A.) IITs generally roll out their form separately. After the declaration of CAT results, you can find the application link on their website. You have to give all the details regarding your profile. Then there they used to ask 3-4 questions based on your career goals, the objective of joining an MBA, and questions resembling your SOP.
      After you get shortlisted here, you will be called for the WAT/PI process which will be held at 5 different nodal centers. You can choose your center accordingly. The WAT revolves around general topics or current issues. For me, it was ‘How EV as Public transport can help in attaining sustainability’. Then you will be headed towards your Interview panel where you will be interviewed and then the final verdict comes up through your mail.
      
      `,
      `4.) Could you please mention some of your interview questions to our readers?`,
      `A.) Yes sure, my interview generally revolved around my work-ex. They asked me about my current company, their net worth, my role in detail, and our competitors. Then they asked about the technology I was working in and I mentioned it to be Salesforce. Then they started asking about Salesforce, how it operates, the different clouds, and who are the competitors of Salesforce. Then they asked some HR questions regarding why MBA despite having a job, which section you enjoyed the most in CAT, why is your VARC score not good, and which companies you are willing to join in placements. Some general questions around it like when I mentioned about Food Processing and Energy company they asked me to give some examples around it and asked for the reason behind choosing them.
      `,
      `5.)  How would you describe your experience as a student of MBA in IIT, Madras?
      `,
      `A.) Joining IITM is one of the best decisions I cherish in my life. Our batch size is 94 students from different backgrounds with different levels of experience. This gives you a variety of minds to interact with. The course curriculum is very structured and application-oriented. We have some of the best faculties at the world level you can say who are expert in their domain and being a small size batch the one-on-one interaction with them in and outside class is very fruitful. Starting from learning the theory to applying it in various case studies and projects gives a wholesome experience. Further, we used to have industry connects on a weekly basis where you get to learn from business leaders.
      Coming to the fun part the department comes together to celebrate and enjoy. Starting from auctions and sports tournaments we celebrate many festivals with pomp and show.
      The IIT ecosystem adds the cherry to the top. We have one of the biggest Incubation centers where you can apply to incubate your startup when the cohort opens. You get a chance to interact with some of the best minds of our nation and work with them on their projects and events. Many workshops and sessions are lined up every weekend to enrich your knowledge and experience.
      
      `,
      `6.)  What are your plans after completing your MBA?
      `,
      `A.) : I am looking forward to growing and elevating my career in the corporate domain. `,
